# Pocora Freeware Ver. English Translation

English translation project for the Freeware edition of **ふしぎな森のポコラ** (The Pocora of the Mysterious Forest) by circle Lizsoft/Marckensoft.

Patch made by the FS Fan Discord (mostly me). The patch does not contain any original assets from the game or from the circle, and is intended to work exclusively with the Freeware edition of the game, and not with the deluxe edition **ふしぎな森のポコラ ハイ！** (The Pocora of the Mysterious Forest Hai!), the DAISO release or the add-on **ボイスパック プラス** (Voice Pack Plus). The patch is not intended to be sold, make money or pirate the game in any way. Only to make it more accessible to english-speaking audiences, as fans of the circle Lizsoft.

If you like the game, please support the original creator if you can.

## Patch

Provided is a XDelta3 (.xdelta) patch file (currently v1.00) for the Freeware edition of the game, versions 1.30X.

To apply the patch, use a XDelta3 utility program such as Delta Patcher, XDeltaUI or XDelta3 and apply the .xdelta patch file onto the `prs.exe` of an appropriate game version. The latest freeware release is available officially on [Vector](https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/win95/game/se322821.html) (v1.301) and is supported by the current patch.

### Notes

The game is by default in Fullscreen Mode, which, as the game is very old (2004), may not run well on OSes older than Windows XP. It is recommended you go to Options > Screen Mode and choose either Windowed Mode or Safe Fullscreen Mode.

## Safety

I'm wary of providing an executable file to a general audience. I take security issues very seriously, and I want to be as transparent as possible with my project.

Although it was considered (to have more flexible string sizes and graphic assets), no code was changed from the original file, only read-only strings and graphic resources. This can be verified with some utilities like WinMerge for example. Comparing the code segment of the original version with the translated version will show that they are identical.

Additionally, if you visit the FS Fan Discord, you can find files I used to create the translated version (a spreadsheet and a python script), and inspect and re-do the entire process yourself.

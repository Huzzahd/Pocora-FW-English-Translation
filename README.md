Fan-made english translation project for the Freeware edition of **ふしぎな森のポコラ** (The Pocora of the Mysterious Forest) by circle Lizsoft/Marckensoft.

Patch made by the FS Fan Discord (mostly me). The patch does not contain any original assets from the game or from the circle, and can only be used with an original copy of the freeware edition of the game.

The patch is intended to make the game more accessible to english-speaking audiences, as fans of the circle Lizsoft. If you like the game, please support the original creator if you can. The full game is available for purchase on the following websites:

- Vector PC Shop ([Deluxe Ed. + Voice Pack Add-on](https://pcshop.vector.co.jp/service/servlet/Catalogue.Detail.Top?ITEM_NO=SR086402)).

## Patch

Provided is a XDelta3 (.xdelta) patch file (currently v1.00) for the Freeware edition of the game, versions 1.30X.

To apply the patch, use a XDelta3 utility program such as Delta Patcher, XDeltaUI or XDelta3 and apply the .xdelta patch file onto the `prs.exe` of an appropriate game version. The latest freeware release is available officially on [Vector](https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/win95/game/se322821.html) (v1.301) and is supported by the current patch.

### Notes

The game is by default in Fullscreen Mode, which, as the game is very old (2004), may not run well on OSes older than Windows XP. It is recommended you go to Options > Screen Mode and choose either Windowed Mode or Safe Fullscreen Mode.

There may also be issues launching the game, as reported by some users. In these cases, changing the program's compatibility setting to Windows XP should solve it. As a last resort, you may try setting your system locale to japanese, or using a locale emulator.

## Safety

I'm wary of providing an executable file to a general audience. I take security issues very seriously, and I want to be as transparent as possible with my project.

Although it was considered (to have more flexible string sizes and graphic assets), no code was changed from the original file, only read-only strings and graphic resources. This can be verified with some utilities like WinMerge for example. Comparing the code segment of the original version with the translated version will show that they are identical.

Additionally, if you visit the FS Fan Discord, you can find files I used to create the translated version (a spreadsheet and a python script), and inspect and re-do the entire process yourself.
